🍕 Pizza Store Web Application 🍕
This project is a simple, responsive web application for a fictional pizza store. The application allows users to select a pizza type, size, and quantity, then calculates the total bill dynamically. It also features a smooth order confirmation process using SweetAlert2 for a modern and interactive user experience.

Key Features:
🛒 Dynamic Pricing: Updates the price based on the selected pizza type and size.
📱 Responsive Design: The app is designed to look great on all devices, thanks to CSS Flexbox and a clean, modern UI.
☎️ Contact Details: Includes a dropdown for country codes and an input for phone numbers.
✅ Order Confirmation: Utilizes SweetAlert2 for order confirmation, including generating a unique order ID.
❌ Order Cancellation: Users can easily cancel and reset their order details with a single click.
